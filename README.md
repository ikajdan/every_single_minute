# Every Single Minute

[![Build](https://github.com/ikajdan/every_single_minute/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ikajdan/every_single_minute/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

Every Single Minute is a simple Android widget that displays the current time in a text view. The widget is designed to be used on the home screen of an Android device.

The idea for this widget came from the [Literary Clock](https://www.instructables.com/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/) project by [Jaap Meijers](http://www.eerlijkemedia.nl/), which is a clock that tells time by displaying the text of a book that corresponds to it.
